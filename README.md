        <h2>The Truth About Menstrual Health</h2>
        <p>Menstruation has been surrounded by myths and taboos for centuries, often leading to misconceptions that can
            negatively impact women's health. In many cultures, menstruation is viewed as something dirty or shameful,
            which can result in women feeling embarrassed or even ostracized during their periods. However, it is
            essential to recognize that menstruation is a normal biological process that plays a crucial role in
            reproductive health.</p>
        <p>One common myth is that menstruation makes women physically weak, and they should refrain from physical
            activities during their periods. The truth is that while some women may experience discomfort or fatigue
            during menstruation, moderate exercise can actually help alleviate symptoms like cramps and mood swings.
            Engaging in regular physical activity during your period can also boost energy levels and promote overall
            well-being.</p>
        <p>Another widespread belief is that women should not engage in religious or cultural practices while
            menstruating. This myth has been perpetuated by cultural norms and traditions, but it has no basis in
            scientific fact. Menstruation is a natural process, and it does not make a woman "impure" or unfit to
            participate in daily activities. It's important to challenge these outdated beliefs and support women's
            rights to engage in all aspects of life, regardless of their menstrual cycle.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there is a persistent misconception that menstrual blood is toxic or harmful. This belief has led
            to practices such as isolation of menstruating women or restrictions on their diet and behavior. In reality,
            menstrual blood is composed of the same elements as regular blood and is not harmful in any way. It's simply
            a part of the body's natural process of shedding the uterine lining.</p>
        <p>At the heart of these myths is a lack of education and understanding about menstruation. By increasing
            awareness and providing accurate information, we can help break down the stigma and empower women to take
            control of their menstrual health. It's time to embrace menstruation as a natural, healthy part of life and
            to support women in their journey towards better health and well-being.</p>
